# Alarm Philosophy

### What should be an alarm?
[[ISA-18.2-2016]]: ![[alarm]]

### Principles of alarming
1. **Alarms must require operator response**  - `avoid "nothing you can do" alarm`
2. **Multiple alarms should not signify the same thing**
3. **Alarms must activate based on abnormal conditions, not expected cases** - `separate events from alarms`

Nag alarm - `alarm that nags or just like your multiple succeeding alarms to wake you up in the morning`
