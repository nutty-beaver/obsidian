lecture on Spontaneous Speaking by Matt Abrahams

# Manage anxiety

## Acknowledge your anxiety
Most of the times, you reduce your anxiety when you speak it out loud and even communicate it to your audience

## Reframe how you see the situation
This is a conversation, not a performance. Your goal is to communicate, not to impress.
- start with questions you need to answer
- use conversational language: instead of "**one** must do this", say "**you** must do this"
- live on the present: don't do "10 steps ahead" tactics. Always focus on what you're saying right now, not what will you say later.
- Warm up your voice
